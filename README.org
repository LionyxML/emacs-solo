Emacs Solo is a configuration for when I wanna go back to the roots
and test my self using Emacs with only =built-in= goodies.

It is minimalist and powerful. A place I visit once in a while.

And much more...

** As seen on System Crafters!

Also, check out the full demo of =Emacs Solo= in action, as seen on
the System Crafters channel. In this video, David Wilson explores and
learns from the configuration, showing how different settings and
approaches are applied to create a more efficient and personalized
Emacs setup.

** Minimum Emacs Version

Emacs-Solo always requires the latest stable release of Emacs, which
is currently: =30.1=

However, some bleeding-edge features may be tested as well. For those,
you’ll need to compile Emacs from the master branch. I do my best to
mark these features with the =Emacs 31= tag.

** External Dependencies
- =ripgrep= (rg)

  This provides quicker project grep and xref navigation.

  If you opt to use regular =grep=, reset the customization of =grep-command=.


- =gls=

  MacOS comes with an implementation of =ls= that misses some nice
  switches from the gnu implementation (=gls= on homebrew). If you opt
  to use MacOS defaul =ls= you might need to change the
  =dired-listing-switches= variable.


- =curl=

  Only needed if you'd like to upload text/images directly to 0x0.st
  site from Emacs Solo.


- =mpv=

  Only needed if you'd like to play videos directly from news in =newsticker=.


** Installation

Clone this repository into a directory of your liking and run Emacs
with:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  emacs --init-directory=YOUR_DIR
#+END_SRC

You can also simply copy *init.el* and *early-init.el* into any folder
issue the same command as above

And that's it, happy hacking! 🐂

** Important Notice

I’m happy to share this configuration with a catchy name, and I’d be
genuinely delighted if you find it useful. 🙂

However, this is *not* intended to be a distribution. This means I may
not cover every user's needs, nor will I accept every contribution
that pushes it in that direction. I use this configuration daily for
both personal and professional work, and like any custom setup, it
reflects my own preferences.

For example, this config does not include Python-specific settings,
whether for Eglot or Tree-sitter. Since this is a real working setup
and I’m not currently using Python, its absence might seem like an
oversight.

If you'd like to add your own modifications while staying up to date
with Emacs Solo, simply create a =private.el= file in the same directory
as =init.el=. A hook is already in place to load this private file after
Emacs initializes.

Of course, you can also fork it! (please do 😊)

** How do I...
*** 1.) Copy the current word under cursor?
The usual answer is *M-b* to go back to the beginning of the
word. *C-M-SPC* to expand the selection to the end of the word and *M-w*.

*Custom Emacs-Solo Solution*: Use the isearch way to search a word (it has
better completion than C-M-SPC), like *M-s M-.* you can now just *M-w*.

*** 2.) Edit multiple search entries at once?

#+BEGIN_SRC text
  Original problem: I usually consult-outline, then embark-collect and wgrep...
#+END_SRC

You can start by using *occur*, or using *isearch* and than moving to occur.

Next start the edit mode of the occur buffer with *e*.

Make your changes, apply it with *C-c C-c*

From Emacs 30.1 onward you can also use the combo:
=replace-regexp-as-diff= for replacements in a single buffer,
=multi-replace-regexp-as-diff= for multiple buffers, and
=dired-do-replace-regexp-as-diff= to perform replace-regexp-as-diff

*** 3.) Edit multiple search entries between several files at once?

#+BEGIN_SRC text
  Original problem: I usually consult-grep, then use embark collect and wgrep...
#+END_SRC

Open dired on the root folder of where you search will happen. Mark
some files and or folders with *m*.

Use =dired-do-query-replace-regexp= or in a dired buffer hit =Q=.

Confirm it all or one by one, use *?* to check the options.

From Emacs 30.1 onward you can also use the combo:
=replace-regexp-as-diff= for replacements in a single buffer,
=multi-replace-regexp-as-diff= for multiple buffers, and
=dired-do-replace-regexp-as-diff= to perform replace-regexp-as-diff

*** 4.) Read news, like with elfeed?

You have two built-in options on Emacs.
- =M-x gnus=
- =M-x newsticker-treeview=

*** 5.) How do I see logs and their diffs?

=C-x v L= on a file inside your version controlled file. And over the
line you have the commit, press =d= for diffing.

If you wanna diff a range, mark the lines starting with =C-SPC= on the
first line of the range, and again =C-SPC= in the last line of the range
(the content of what you want must be selected, if ther cursor is on
first column of the line it won't be included), now use =d= to diff.

*** 6.) How do I revert a hunk?
=C-x v == will open the diff panel for the current file, restrict it to
the hunk you'd like to revert with =r=, revert the direction of the diff
with =R= and apply the diff with =C-c C-a=.

*** 7.) Use (neo)vi(m) keybindings (aka Evil keybindings)?

Emacs comes with =viper= which is a =vi= emulator. This means a lot of
modern editing capabilities are missing.

Take a look at =use-package emacs-solo-viper-extensions=, section of the
=init.el= file. Emacs Solo extends viper mode to include a bunch of more
modern =evil-like= bindings.

Just give it a try ;) =M-x viper-mode=

*** 8.) Temporaraly highlight some word?

Use the powers of =highlight-regexp=! Over a word you want to make
highlighted use =M-s h .=

You can repeat it to other words and Emacs will handle different
colors for you.

To remove a highlight use =M-s h u= and select the highlighted regexp on
the list.

Find out about more options regarding highlighting with =M-s h ?=.

*** 9.) Know what is changed when closing Emacs or several files?

It is a common thing trying to close Emacs with =C-x C-c= just to find
out one of your buffers has some modification and now Emacs asks if
you'd like to save, override, etc.

Emacs Solo provides the extra option =d=, which will generate a diff of
the current file being asked to take action, so you can see if saving
is needed.
