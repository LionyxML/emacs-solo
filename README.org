Emacs Solo is a configuration for when I wanna go back to the roots
and test my self using Emacs with only the built-in goodies.

It is minimalist and powerful. A place I visit once in a while.

** Installation

Save the src_sh[:exports code]{<tag>init.el</tag>} file into a directory
of your liking and run Emacs with:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
emacs --init-directory=YOUR_DIR
#+END_SRC

And that's it, happy hacking! üêÇ
