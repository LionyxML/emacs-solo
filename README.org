Emacs Solo is a configuration for when I wanna go back to the roots
and test my self using Emacs with only =built-in= goodies.

It is minimalist and powerful. A place I visit once in a while.

** Installation

Clone this repository into a directory of your liking and run Emacs
with:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  emacs --init-directory=YOUR_DIR
#+END_SRC

You can also simply copy *init.el* and *early-init.el* into any folder
issue the same command as above

And that's it, happy hacking! 🐂

** External Dependencies
- ripgrep (for quick project grep and xref)
- gls (macos only)
- curl (for 0x0)
- mpv (for newsticker)

** How do I...
*** 1.) Copy the current word under cursor?
The usual answer is *M-b* to go back to the beginning of the
word. *C-M-SPC* to expand the selection to the end of the word and *M-w*.

*Custom Emacs-Solo Solution*: Use the isearch way to search a word (it has
better completion than C-M-SPC), like *M-s M-.* you can now just *M-w*.

*** 2.) Edit multiple search entries at once?

#+BEGIN_SRC text
  Original problem: I usually consult-outline, then embark-collect and wgrep...
#+END_SRC

You can start by using *occur*, or using *isearch* and than moving to occur.

Next start the edit mode of the occur buffer with *e*.

Make your changes, apply it with *C-c C-c*

From Emacs 30.1 onward you can also use the combo:
=replace-regexp-as-diff= for replacements in a single buffer,
=multi-replace-regexp-as-diff= for multiple buffers, and
=dired-do-replace-regexp-as-diff= to perform replace-regexp-as-diff

*** 3.) Edit multiple search entries between several files at once?

#+BEGIN_SRC text
  Original problem: I usually consult-grep, then use embark collect and wgrep...
#+END_SRC

Open dired on the root folder of where you search will happen. Mark
some files and or folders with *m*.

Use =dired-do-query-replace-regexp= or in a dired buffer hit =Q=.

Confirm it all or one by one, use *?* to check the options.

From Emacs 30.1 onward you can also use the combo:
=replace-regexp-as-diff= for replacements in a single buffer,
=multi-replace-regexp-as-diff= for multiple buffers, and
=dired-do-replace-regexp-as-diff= to perform replace-regexp-as-diff

*** 4.) Read news, like with elfeed?

You have two built-in options on Emacs.
- =M-x gnus=
- =M-x newsticker-treeview=

*** 5.) How do I see logs and their diffs?

=C-x v L= on a file inside your version controlled file. And over the
line you have the commit, press =d= for diffing.

If you wanna diff a range, mark the lines starting with =C-SPC= on the
first line of the range, and again =C-SPC= in the last line of the range
(the content of what you want must be selected, if ther cursor is on
first column of the line it won't be included), now use =d= to diff.

*** 6.) How do I revert a hunk?

=C-x v === will open the diff panel for the current file, restrict it to
the hunk you'd like to revert with =r=, revert the direction of the diff
with =R= and apply the diff with =C-c C-a=.

*** 7.) Use (neo)vi(m) keybindings (aka Evil keybindings)?

Emacs comes with =viper= which is a =vi= emulator. This means a lot of
modern editing capabilities are missing.

Take a look at =use-package emacs-solo-viper-extensions=, section of the
=init.el= file. Emacs Solo extends viper mode to include a bunch of more
modern =evil-like= bindings.

Just give it a try ;) =M-x viper-mode=

*** 8.) Temporaraly highlight some word?

Use the powers of =highlight-regexp=! Over a word you want to make
highlighted use =M-s h .=

You can repeat it to other words and Emacs will handle different
colors for you.

To remove a highlight use =M-s h u= and select the highlighted regexp on
the list.

Find out about more options regarding highlighting with =M-s h ?=.

*** 9.) Know what is changed when closing Emacs or several files?

It is a common thing trying to close Emacs with =C-x C-c= just to find
out one of your buffers has some modification and now Emacs asks if
you'd like to save, override, etc.

Emacs Solo provides the extra option =d=, which will generate a diff of
the current file being asked to take action, so you can see if saving
is needed.
